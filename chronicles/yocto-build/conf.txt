build/conf:
===========
1. The Configuration files are stored in the 'build/conf' directory. They are used by the BitBake in the Build process.
2. The sample Configuration files stored in the 'meta-poky' directory are used as a template to create the actual Configuration files by the developer.
3. The most important Configuration files are as follows:
	1) local.conf
	2) bblayers.conf
	3) site.conf
	4) auto.conf

build/conf/local.conf:
**********************
1. The 'local.conf' Configuration file contains all the local User Configurations for the Build Environment.
2. It provides the definition of many basic variables that define the Build Environment.
3. The variables provided are:
	1) MACHINE => It controls the Machine for which the Target Image is being Built.
		---> The default value for the Target Machine is selected as 'qemux86-64' if no other Machine is selected.
		---> MACHINE ??= "qemux86"
	2) DL_DIR => It controls the directory path where the Build system downloads the different source code Tarballs fetched from the various Projects.
		---> The default path for the downloads directory is under the Build (TOPDIR) directory.
		---> DL_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/downloads"
	3) TMPDIR => It controls the directory path where the Build system places the Build Output i.e. the bulk of Build work is executed and the temporary files is placed.
		---> The default path for the temporary directory is under the Build (TOPDIR) directory.
		---> TMPDIR = "${TOPDIR}/tmp"
	4) SSTATE_DIR => It controls the directory path where the Build system places the Shared-State files which are like Cache to accelerate the Build based on previous Build.
		---> Even if the TMPDIR is wiped out leaving this directory intact, the Build would regenerate from these files if no changes were made to the Configuration.
		---> If there is any change to the Configuration, only the Shared-State files where the State is valid would be used (done using checksums).
		---> The default path for the Shared-State Cache is under the Build (TOPDIR) directory.
		---> SSTATE_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/sstate-cache"
	5) DISTRO => It controls the Distribution or Policy settings that are to be used for the Build. Initially, it can be a default value but later they are custom Distros.
		---> The default Policy Configuration for the Yocto Project is Poky.
		---> DISTRO ?= "poky"
	6) PACKAGE_CLASSES => It controls the type of Package formats to be enabled in the Build system. Even multiple Package formats can be enabled at once.
		---> The order in which the Package formats are listed matters. The first item listed in the variable (if available) is used by the BitBake.
		---> PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm package_deb package_ipk"
		---> The 'package_rpm' is the default format for Poky.
		---> PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm"
	7) SDKMACHINE => It controls the Target Architecture to build the SDK items for. The SDK Packages can be Built for Architectures other than the Machine running the Build.
		---> The supported Architecture values for Poky are 'i686', 'x86_64' and 'aarch64'.
		---> SDKMACHINE ?= "i686"
	8) EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES => It controls the additional Packages to be added to the generated Image. Some of these options are added to certain Image types automatically.
		---> There are other features that can be used which are listed in the Class files: 'meta/classes*/'.
		---> EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES ?= "allow-empty-password empty-root-password allow-root-login"
4. Any variable that is defined in this file overrides the definition of that variable set elsewhere within the Environment unless that variable is hard-coded within a file.
5. The sample Configuration file of 'local.conf' is present in the 'meta-poky/conf' directory under the name of 'local.conf.sample'.
6. If this Configuration file is not present when the Build Environment script is sourced, the Build system creates it from the sample Configuration file.
