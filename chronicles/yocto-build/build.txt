The Build Directory:
====================
1. The Build directory refers to the area used by the OpenEmbedded Project Build system for all the Build related activities.
2. It is created when the Build Environment script is sourced.
3. The BitBake initializes the 'TOPDIR' variable with the directory path for the Build directory.
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^TOPDIR=
	   TOPDIR="/home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build"
4. The 'build' directory contains a Temporary directory that is used to store all the Build Output and intermediate files other than the Shared-State Cache.
5. This Temporary directory cannot be under NFS (Network Filesystem) directory. Therefore by default, the Build directory cannot be under NFS.
