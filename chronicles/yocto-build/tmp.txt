build/tmp:
==========
1. In the Build Environment, the 'tmp' directory is used as the main working and Output directory by the BitBake.
2. This is the location to store all the Build artifacts, the intermediate files and the final Image binaries during the Build process.
3. It is important for incremental Builds by speeding up the Build process. If a part of the Project changes, the Build system only Builds the specific changes in the Recipes.
4. The Build process ensures the integrity of the source by separation of the original Inputs (Recipes) and the generated Output files by keeping them in this directory.
5. This makes the version control simpler without the need of messy '.gitignore' files.
6. Most of the Disk space usage in a Yocto Build comes from this directory.
