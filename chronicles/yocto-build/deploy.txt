tmp/deploy:
===========
1. The 'tmp/deploy' directory contains the final Output produced by the OpenEmbedded Build process.
2. It is essential for the deployment, flashing or further sharing of the Build Output.
3. The 'DEPLOY_DIR' variable controls the directory path.
4. The following sub-directories are present in this directory:
	1) deb
	2) images
	3) ipk
	4) licenses
	5) rpm

deploy/deb:
***********
1. The 'deploy/deb' directory is used to contain all the '.deb' Packages produced during the Build process.
2. These Packages are organized into the sub-directories that categorize these Packages based on the various Architectures.
3. This method of Package organization makes it easy to locate and deploy the relevant Packages.
3. The directory structure is as follows:
	=> deb/
	   ├── all/
	   │   └── <noarch-packages>.deb
	   ├── armv7at2hf-neon/
	   │   └── <armv7at2hf-packages>.deb
	   ├── beaglebone/
	   │   └── <beaglebone-packages>.deb
	   ├── <other-archs>/
	   │   └── <arch-specific-packages>.deb
	   └── qemuarm/
	       └── <qemuarm-packages>.deb
	---> all => Architecture-independent Packages.
	---> armv7at2hf => Architecture-specific Packages.
	---> beaglebone => Machine-specific Packages.
	---> qemuarm => QEMU Target-specific Packages.
