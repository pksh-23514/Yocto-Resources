build/downloads:
================
1. In the Build Environment, the 'downloads' directory is used to store source code and other assets that are fetched during the Build process.
2. The directory caches all kinds of the source files:
	1) Tarballs or Archives (.tar.gz, .zip etc)
	2) Git repository clones or their shallow Mirrors
	3) Patches
	4) Other remote files defined in the Recipes
3. Once the sources are downloaded in a fresh Online Build, they can be used during the subsequent Builds. This avoids the re-downloading of the files.
4. It also facilitates the Offline Builds since the sources are already present in the directory.
