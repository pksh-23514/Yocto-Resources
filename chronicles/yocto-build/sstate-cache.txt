build/sstate-cache:
===================
1. In the Build Environment, the 'sstate-cache' directory is used to store the Shared-State Cache that are a critical part of the Yoctoâ€™s Build performance.
2. The Shared-State Cache is a system that Caches the results of the Build Tasks so that they can be reused in the future Builds.
3. Each Task in the Yocto Project (like do_fetch, do_unpack, do_compile, do_install etc.) have Inputs (like Meta-data, Configurations etc.) to the BitBake.
4. If the Inputs haven't changed since the last Build, the Outputs of these Inputs should remain the same as well. This logic is used by the Shared-State Cache.
5. The Shared-State Cache stores the Outputs of the Build Tasks as 'Sstate Object files' so that they can be restored directly instead of recomputing.
6. Instead of again Compiling or processing every task, the Build checks this directory for a previously completed version of the Task with matching Inputs exists or not.
7. These Cached Outputs are stored as 'tar.gz' or '.tar.zst' file.
8. It dramatically reduces the Build time by avoiding the Build of the unchanged Tasks. It also prevents the repeated downloads and processing of the same sources again.
9. It supports the reproducibility (Build consistency across Environments) and the Build Distribution across Machines/Users.
