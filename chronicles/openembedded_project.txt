The OpenEmbedded Project:
=========================
1. The OpenEmbedded Project is an Open-Source framework used primarily for creating complete Embedded Linux Distributions.
2. It provides a best in-class Cross-Compile Environment containing all the tools and Meta-data to create custom Linux Images.
3. The key features of the OpenEmbedded Project are:
	1) It automates the Build process of Cross-Compilation and packaging SW for different HW Architectures.
	2) It uses a Task executor called the BitBake which is similar the Make but optimized for Embedded Linux development.
	3) It contains the Meta-data organized logically into Layers.
	4) It is flexible in creating different Distributions by customizing/combining various Layers.
	5) It supports a wide variety of CPU Architectures like ARM, x86, MIPS etc.
4. It was first released in the early 2000s.

The OpenEmbedded Project vs the Yocto Project:
==============================================
1. Both the OpenEmbedded Project and the Yocto Project are separate Projects with their own area of focus.
2. By the definition of both:
	1) The Yocto Project is a collaborative Open-Source project that provides the tools, Meta-data and the processes for building custom Linux Distributions.
	2) The OpenEmbedded Project is a Build framework that provides a comprehensive set of Meta-data for a wide range of HW Architectures.
3. By the governance of both:
	1) The Yocto Project is maintained by the Linux Foundation.
	2) The OpenEmbedded Project is Community-driven. Therefore, it more de-centralized than the Yocto Project.
4. By the components of both:
	1) The Yocto Project share a core collection of Meta-data with the OpenEmbedded Project called as the OpenEmbedded-Core.
	2) The OpenEmbedded Project is the original maintainer for the OpenEmbedded-Core Meta-data.
5. By the reference Distro of both:
	1) The Yocto Project contains a reference Distribution called Poky. It contains the BitBake through Poky only.
	2) The OpenEmbedded Project is the original maintainer for the BitBake Build Engine.
6. The OpenEmbedded Project is designed to be the foundation for flexible Linux Build framework. It is used by the Yocto Project for various functional requirements.
