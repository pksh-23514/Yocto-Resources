OpenEmbedded Project:
=====================
1. The OpenEmbedded Project is an Open-Source framework used primarily for creating complete Embedded Linux Distributions.
2. It provides a best in-class Cross-Compile environment containing all the tools and Meta-data to create custom Linux Images.
3. The key features of the OpenEmbedded Project are:
	1) It automates the Build process of Cross-Compilation and packaging SW for different HW Architectures.
	2) It uses a Task executor called the BitBake which is similar the Make but optimized for Embedded Linux development.
	3) It contains the Meta-data organized logically into Layers.
	4) It is flexible in creating different Distributions by customizing/combining various Layers.
	5) It supports a wide variety of CPU Architectures like ARM, x86, MIPS etc.
