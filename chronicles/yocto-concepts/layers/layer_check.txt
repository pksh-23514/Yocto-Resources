yocto-check-layer Script:
=========================
1. The 'yocto-check-layer' script provides the way to assess how compatible the Layer is with the Yocto Project.
	=> yocto-check-layer <absolute-path-to-the-Layer>/layer-name
2. The 'PASS' result indicates that the Layer is compatible with the Yocto Project.
3. The script divides the tests into the three areas i.e. COMMON, BSP and DISTRO.
	1) Given a Distro Layer, it must pass the COMMON and DISTRO set of tests.
	2) Given a BSP Layer, it must pass the COMMON and BSP set of tests.
