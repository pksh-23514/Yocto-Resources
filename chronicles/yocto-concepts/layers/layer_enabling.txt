Steps to Enable Layer Manually:
===============================
1. In the Build directory, the Layer directory path should be updated to the 'conf/bblayers.conf' file to include the Layer in the Build system.
	=> BBLAYERS ?= "\
	       ...
	       <absolute-path-to-the-Layer>/layer-name \
	       "
2. The BitBake parses each of the 'conf/layer.conf' file from the 'BBLAYERS' variable in a top-down approach.
