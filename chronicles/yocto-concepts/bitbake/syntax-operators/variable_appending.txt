Appending Values with Space:
============================
1. The '+=' operator is used for appending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE += "value"
2. The operation takes into effect immediately during the parsing by the BitBake.
3. It inserts a space between the current value of the variable and the appended value.
	=> VAL8 = "Hello"
	=> VAL8 += "World"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL8=
	---> VAL8="Hello World"

Appending Values without Space:
===============================
1. The '.=' operator is used for appending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE .= "value"
2. The operation takes into effect immediately during the parsing by the BitBake.
3. It does not insert any space between the current value of the variable and the appended value.
	=> VAL8 = "Hello"
	=> VAL8 .= "World"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL8=
	---> VAL8="HelloWorld"

Appending Values using Override Style Syntax:
=============================================
1. The Override Syntax can be used for appending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE:append = "value"
2. It does not insert any space between the current value of the variable and the appended value. Therefore, the space controlling shall be done while using this Syntax.
	=> VAL9 = "Hello"
	=> VAL9:append = "!"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL9=
	---> VAL9="Hello!"
3. The operation takes into effect during the variable expansion only i.e. it is not applied immediately.
	=> VAL9 = "Hello"
	=> VAL9:append = " !"
	=> VAL9 += "World"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL9=
	---> VAL9="Hello World !"
