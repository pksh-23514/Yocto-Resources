Appending Values with Space:
============================
1. The '+=' operator is used for appending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE += "value"
2. The operation takes into effect immediately during the parsing by the BitBake.
3. It inserts a space between the current value of the variable and the appended value.
	=> VAL8 = "Hello"
	=> VAL8 += "World"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL8=
	---> VAL8="Hello World"

Appending Values without Space:
===============================
1. The '.=' operator is used for appending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE .= "value"
2. The operation takes into effect immediately during the parsing by the BitBake.
3. It does not insert any space between the current value of the variable and the appended value.
	=> VAL8 = "Hello"
	=> VAL8 .= "World"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL8=
	---> VAL8="HelloWorld"
