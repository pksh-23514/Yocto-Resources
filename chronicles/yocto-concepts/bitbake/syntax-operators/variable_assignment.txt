Variable Assignment:
====================
1. The variables are assigned in the following manner:
	=> VARIABLE = "value"
2. The value assignment occurs as soon as the statement is parsed by the BitBake.
3. This type of variable assignment is known as Hard assignment.
4. If any leading or trailing spaces are a part of the assignment, the spaces are retained while parsing.
	=> VARIABLE = "value "
	=> VARIABLE = " value"
	=> VARIABLE = ""	// Empty String
	=> VARIABLE = " "	// Blank Space
5. The single quotes can be used in place of the double quotes for the assignment of the variables. Both the styles work identically in the variable assignment.
6. However, using the single quotes assignment style allows the use of double quotes in the value.
	=> VARIABLE = 'There is a " in the value'
7. The preferred style of assignment is using the double quotes.
