Prepending Values with Space:
=============================
1. The '=+' operator is used for prepending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE =+ "value"
2. The operation takes into effect immediately during the parsing by the BitBake.
3. It inserts a space between the current value of the variable and the prepended value.
	=> VAL8 = "World"
	=> VAL8 =+ "Hello"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL8=
	---> VAL8="Hello World"

Prepending Values without Space:
================================
1. The "=." operator is used for prepending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE =. "value"
2. The operation takes into effect immediately during the parsing by the BitBake.
3. It does not insert any space between the current value of the variable and the prepended value.
	=> VAL8 = "World"
	=> VAL8 =. "Hello"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL8=
	---> VAL8="HelloWorld"

Prepending Values using Override Style Syntax:
==============================================
1. The Override Syntax can be used for prepending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE:prepend = "value"
2. It does not insert any space between the current value of the variable and the prepended value. Therefore, the space controlling shall be done while using this Syntax.
	=> VAL9 ="!"
	=> VAL9:prepend = "Hello"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL9=
	---> VAL9="Hello!"
3. The operation takes into effect during the variable expansion only i.e. it is not applied immediately.
	=> VAL9 ="!"
	=> VAL9:prepend = "Hello "
	=> VAL9 =+ "World"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL9=
	---> VAL9="Hello World !"

Override Style Operation Advantages:
************************************
1. The major advantage of the Override Syntax as compared to the other two operators is that it provides guaranteed operation on the variable.
	1) In the 'local.conf' file, add the following statement:
		=> IMAGE_INSTALL =+ "usbutils"
		=> bitbake -e core-image-minimal | grep ^IMAGE_INSTALL=
		---> IMAGE_INSTALL="packagegroup-core-boot "
		---> The above result is not desirable as the 'usbutils' value has not been prepended to the 'IMAGE_INSTALL' variable.
	2) In the 'local.conf' file, add the following statement:
		=> IMAGE_INSTALL:prepend = "usbutils "
		=> bitbake -e core-image-minimal | grep ^IMAGE_INSTALL=
		---> IMAGE_INSTALL="usbutils packagegroup-core-boot "
	3) This behavior is observed because of the order of passing of the 'local.conf' file is different in both the scenarios.
	4) The 'IMAGE_INSTALL' variable doesn't have any value when it encountered the '=+' operator, which is then replaced by the value using Hard assignment.
	5) However, the 'IMAGE_INSTALL' variable does have the value before encountering the ':prepend' operation. Hence, the desirable value is achieved.
	6) If the 'core-image-minimal.bb' file is updated after the 'IMAGE_INSTALL' variable is defined, then the value is same in both the scenarios.
2. The second advantage of the Override Syntax is that it can be combined with the other conditional Syntax (or Overrides).
