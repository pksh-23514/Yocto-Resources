Prepending Values with Space:
=============================
1. The '=+' operator is used for prepending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE =+ "value"
2. The operation takes into effect immediately during the parsing by the BitBake.
3. It inserts a space between the current value of the variable and the prepended value.
	=> VAL8 = "World"
	=> VAL8 =+ "Hello"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL8=
	---> VAL8="Hello World"

Prepending Values without Space:
================================
1. The "=." operator is used for prepending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE =. "value"
2. The operation takes into effect immediately during the parsing by the BitBake.
3. It does not insert any space between the current value of the variable and the prepended value.
	=> VAL8 = "World"
	=> VAL8 =. "Hello"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL8=
	---> VAL8="HelloWorld"

Prepending Values using Override Style Syntax:
==============================================
1. The Override Syntax can be used for prepending the values to a variable.
	=> VARIABLE:prepend = "value"
2. It does not insert any space between the current value of the variable and the prepended value. Therefore, the space controlling shall be done while using this Syntax.
	=> VAL9 ="!"
	=> VAL9:prepend = "Hello"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL9=
	---> VAL9="Hello!"
3. The operation takes into effect during the variable expansion only i.e. it is not applied immediately.
	=> VAL9 ="!"
	=> VAL9:prepend = "Hello "
	=> VAL9 =+ "World"
	=> bitbake -e | grep ^VAL9=
	---> VAL9="Hello World !"
