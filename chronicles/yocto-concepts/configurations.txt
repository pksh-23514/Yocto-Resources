Configurations:
===============
1. Configurations are used to define the global definition of the variables that govern the Build process.
2. These Configuration files fall under several categories that define different aspects of the Build:
	1) Machine Configuration options
	2) Distro Configuration options
	3) Compiler-tuning options
	4) Common Configuration options
	5) User Configuration options
3. They provide the information about the what to Build and the components of the final Image to support a particular platform.
4. They are usually placed as the sub-directory 'conf' inside the 'meta*/' directory of the Build system.
5. These files have the suffix as '.conf' to distinguish themselves as a Configuration file.
6. The most common Configuration files are:
	1) local.conf
	2) bblayers.conf
	3) distro.conf
	4) machine.conf
	5) layer.conf
	6) auto.conf
	7) site.conf
7. They are expected to be structured and placed under the 'conf' directory in the Build system for the BitBake to be aware of their location.
8. The 'BBPATH' variable contains a colon-separated list used by BitBake to locate Configuration files. They are searched for  in the Build directory by the BitBake.
9. It is mandatory for all the Layers (meta*/) to have the 'conf' sub-directory.
	1) It must have at least 'conf/layer.conf' file in order to be a valid Yocto Layer.
	2) If a Layer is added without this file to the 'bblayers.conf' file, then the BitBake raises an error.
	3) However, if a Layer is not meant to be a Yocto Layer or if it is a sub-directory inside a Yocto Layer; then it doesn't need this file.
