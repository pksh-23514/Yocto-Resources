Sample Filesystem Layout for BSP Layer:
=======================================
1. The BSP Layer has a common directory structure for the end Users to get familiarized with the Yocto Project or the OpenEmbedded Project standards.
2. However, this standard structure can also be used with the other Build systems as well.
3. It is also intended that the standard structure will be easier to extract the information and convert it into other formats if required.
4. For the OpenEmbedded Project, the standard Layer mechanism is directly accepted.
5. The BSP Layer captures all the HW-specific details in one place using a standard format.
6. This enables to include the Layer directly for using the HW platform regardless of the Build system.
7. The BSP specification does not include a particular Build system or other tools. It is concerned with the HW-specific components only.
8. At the end Distribution point, the BSP Layer can be combined with the Build system and other tools.
9. There is a checklist to be ticked in order for a BSP Layer to be considered as compliant with the Yocto Project.
10. The sample structure for a standard BSP Layer (includes but not limited to):
	1) License files
	2) README file
	3) README.sources file
	4) Pre-Built binaries
	5) Layer Configuration file
	6) HW Configuration options
	7) BSP-specific Recipes
	8) Display support files
	9) Linux Kernel Configurations
