Source Materials:
=================
1. In order for the Build system to create an Image or any Target, it must be able to access the source files.
2. The BitBake uses the 'SRC_URI' variable to point to the source files regardless of their location.
3. Each Recipe must have the 'SRC_URI' variable that should point to the source code required for it's Build.
4. The 'DL_DIR' variable is used to point to the area that is a Cache to hold the previously downloaded source.
5. The Build system can be instructed to create Tarballs from the Git repositories and store them in the 'DL_DIR' directory. This is not the default behavior.
6. The above process can be achieved by using the 'BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS' variable.
7. A good method for using the download directory is to have the directory path outside of the 'build' directory.
	1) So, in case if there is a need to delete the Build directory, the downloaded source is left untouched.
	2) The judicious use of the download directory can save the Build system from the trip across the Internet for downloading the source code.
8. The expanded view of the 'Upstream Project Releases, Local Projects and SCMs' in the 'OpenEmbedded Build Workflow' is as follows:
