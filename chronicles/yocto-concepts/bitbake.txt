BitBake:
========
1. The BitBake is a core component of the Yocto Project and it is at the heart of the OpenEmbedded Project.
2. It is the tool that parses the Meta-data, generates a list of Tasks from it and then executes these Tasks in an orderly manner.
3. Conceptually, it is similar to the GNU Make but they have significant differences among them.
	1) Both the Make and BitBake control the process of SW Build.
	2) Make achieves this control through Makefiles. BitBake achieves this control through Recipes.
	3) BitBake extends the capabilities of a simple tool like Make by allowing for the definition of much more complex Tasks such as assembling entire Linux Distributions.
4. It is written in Python.
5. The link to the BitBake Git repository is: https://git.openembedded.org/bitbake/
6. It is a Task scheduler that performs the following tasks:
	1) It parses the Recipe (.bb) files and the associated files (.bbclass, .inc and .conf) to understand how to fetch, configure, compile and package the SW.
	2) It resolves the Build-time and Run-time dependencies in the Recipes.
	3) It ensures all the required components are Build in the right order.
	4) It executes all the Tasks defined in the Recipes (like do_fetch, do_unpack, do_patch, do_configure, do_compile, do_install, do_package).
	5) It packages the SW (usually as .ipk, .rpm or .deb files) after the Build is completed.
	6) It tracks the Build State for completion and uses checksums (signatures) to determine if something needs to be Build again.
	7) It Caches the Build to avoid any redundant Builds and speed up the Build process.
7. It automates the complete Build process for the custom Linux Distributions.

bitbake Directory in Poky:
**************************
1. The 'bitbake' directory includes a copy of BitBake in Poky for the ease of use. It usually matches the current Stable Release of the BitBake from the BitBake project.
2. When the Build Environment script is sourced, the directory path for 'poky/scripts' and 'poky/bitbake/bin' are included in the 'PATH' Shell Environment variable.
	=> source oe-init-build-env
	=> echo $PATH
	   /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/scripts:/home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/bitbake/bin:...
3. After the Environment is setup, then the 'bitbake' command is available. Otherwise, it will throw an error as 'bitbake: command not found'.
4. The commands (binaries) used in the 'bitbake' directory are:
	1) bitbake
	2) bitbake-layers
	3) bitbake-selftest
	4) bitbake-getvar
	5) toaster
