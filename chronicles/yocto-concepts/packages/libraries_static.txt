Static Libraries:
=================
1. A static library is a collection of Object files that are linked into the program during the Compile time.
2. This type of linking is called static linking.
3. Once the linking is completed, the code from the static library becomes a part of the binary generated.
4. The utility used to create the static libraries is known as Archiver (ar). It can perform the following:
	1) It can create static libraries which can also be called as archive files.
	2) It can modify the Object files present in the static libraries.
	3) It can list the name of the Object files present in the static libraries.
5. The static libraries have an extension of '.a' in Linux.
