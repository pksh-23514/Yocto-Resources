Dynamic Libraries:
==================
1. A dynamic library (also called as Shared library) is a collection of functions and procedures that are loaded into the program at the Run-time.
2. This type of linking is called dynamic linking.
3. The code is not included as a part of the binary. Instead, it is linked dynamically whenever the binary is executed.
4. The utility used to create the dynamic libraries is GCC (gcc).
5. The dynamic libraries have an extension of '.so' in Linux.
