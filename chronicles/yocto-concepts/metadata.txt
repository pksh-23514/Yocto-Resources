Meta-data:
==========
1. Meta-data is a key element of the Yocto Project which refers to the information that describe how the SW Package should be built, configured and integrated into the Image.
2. These information are logically stored in the Layers and they are parsed by the Build system during the Build process.
3. It includes the following:
	1) Recipe files (.bb)
	2) Class files (.bbclass)
	3) Configuration files (.conf)
	4) Include files (.inc)
4. It refers to the Build instruction itself as well as the data to control the Build. It includes the following commands and data:
	1) To indicate the version of SW used in the Build.
	2) To point the source from where the SW is obtained.
	3) To customize the SW (i.e. applying Patches) in a certain manner as per the requirements.
5. It is essential to generate a complete Linux Distribution tailored to a specific HW Device. It allows the Yocto Project to be highly flexible.
