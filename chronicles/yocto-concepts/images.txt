Images:
=======
1. Images are the binary Output that runs on the specific Target HW or QEMU. They are produced by the Build system that contains the Boot files and the complete RootFS.
2. They are an artifact of the BitBake Build process based on the collection of Recipes and Meta-data provided to the Build system.
3. When the Build command is provided to the BitBake, it is actually providing the top-level Recipe that begins the Build process for the type of Image requested.
4. The Output might be in the form:
	1) Filesystem Image (.ext4)
	2) Bootable Image (.wic)
	3) Compressed RootFS (.tar.gz)
5. It is Architecture-specific i.e. they are Built for a specific Architecture. The Target Architecture is mentioned by the Machine Configurations.
6. The Image Recipe files are placed in the 'meta*/recipes*/images/' directory of the Build system.
7. The most commonly used Target Images provided by the Poky are:
	1) core-image-base
	2) core-image-full-cmdline
	3) core-image-minimal
	4) core-image-minimal-dev
	5) core-image-rt
	6) core-image-sato
	7) core-image-weston
