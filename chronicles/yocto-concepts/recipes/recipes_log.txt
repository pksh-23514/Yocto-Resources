Logging the Build Tasks in Recipes:
===================================
1. The Build logs for each of the BitBake Tasks executed for the Recipes are stored in their respective 'WORKDIR' directory.
2. The individual Recipe stores all the logs under the 'temp' directory.
	1) The 'T' variable is used to point to the 'temp' directory for the particular Recipe.
		=> bitbake -e recipe-name | grep ^T=
	2) This 'temp' directory is used by the BitBake to store the temporary files while Building the particular Recipe.
	3) The default value of the variable is defined in the 'meta/conf/bitbake.conf' file.
		=> T = "${WORKDIR}/temp"
3. Each Task that is executed during the individual Recipe Build produces the following kind of files in the 'WORKDIR/temp' directory.
	1) The 'log' file which is the Output log from 'stdout' or 'stderr' for a specific Task executed by the BitBake. It is helpful to debug when a particular Task fails.
	2) The 'run' file which is the actual script containing the commands executed for a specific Task by the BitBake. It is generated based on the Recipe's Meta-data.
4. The naming convention for the 'log' and the 'run' files are as follows:
	1) log.do_<task>.pid
	2) run.<task>.pid
	---> The 'task' represents the name of the specific Task being executed by the BitBake during the Recipe Build.
	---> The 'pid' represents the Linux PID of the specific Task being executed by the BitBake during the Recipe Build.
5. If the particular Recipe's Tasks are executed repeatedly, for each time the Task is executed, the 'log' and the 'run' files are newly generated with the corresponding PID.
6. Therefore, there are Symbolic link provided for each Task's 'log' and 'run' file. They point to the latest generated Task's 'log' and 'run' file respectively.
	=> log.do_compile ---> Latest 'log' file for the 'do_compile' Task executed for the particular Recipe Build.
	=> run.do_compile ---> Latest 'run' file for the 'do_compile' Task executed for the particular Recipe Build.
