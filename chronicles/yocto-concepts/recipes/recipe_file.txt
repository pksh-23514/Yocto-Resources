Recipes:
========
1. Recipes are a text file containing a set of instructions for building a SW.
2. It is written in the BitBake Syntax. They are read and processed by the BitBake during the Build process.
3. These files have the suffix as '.bb' to distinguish themselves as a Recipe file.
4. They represent the fundamental unit of execution for either to Build a particular SW or to Build the custom Linux Image.
5. Each SW component Built by the OpenEmbedded Build system requires a Recipe file to define the component. A single Recipe contains information about a single piece of SW.
6. It provides the following information to the BitBake:
	1) Location to download the unaltered source code.
	2) Patches to be applied on the source code (if any).
	3) Any special Configuration options to be applied.
	4) Compilation process of the source code.
	5) Installation or Packaging process.
	6) License details.
7. Based on these information provided, the BitBake generates a set of Tasks to be performed in a chronological order.

Recipes File Format:
====================
1. The Recipe file name format is defined as follows:
	=> <recipe-name>_<version>.bb
	1) The 'recipe-name' is the name of the SW or the Package being Built.
	2) The 'version' is the version of the SW or the Package being Built.
	---> In the 'poky/meta/recipes-core/dropbear/', the Recipe file for the SSH Dropbear is 'dropbear_2025.88.bb'.
