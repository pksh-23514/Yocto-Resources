Using Virtual Providers in Recipes:
===================================
1. The 'virtual/*' is used to represent an abstract capability or interface and not specific Recipes.
2. The Recipes that fulfill the same functionality can claim to provide this 'virtual' capability.
3. Prior to the Build, if there are several different Recipes that provide the same functionality, the virtual provider acts as a placeholder for the actual provider.
4. The actual provider is determined at the Build-time.
5. Each Recipe file in some way uses the 'PROVIDES' variable that essentially identifies itself as being able to provide the 'virtual' capability.

Common Example of Choosing Linux Kernel Versions:
*************************************************
1. In the 'kirkstone' branch of Poky, there are multiple Linux Kernel Recipes at the 'meta/recipes-kernel/linux/' path.
	1) linux-yocto_5.10.bb
	2) linux-yocto_5.15.bb
2. The 'meta/classes/kernel.bbclass' is used by the Kernel Recipes to include the 'PROVIDES' variable for identifying themselves as virtual provider.
	=> PROVIDES += "virtual/kernel"
3. The 'linux-yocto_5.15.bb' Recipe file uses the 'PROVIDES' variable by inheriting the 'kernel' Class file.
	=> require recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto.inc
	---> The 'linux-yocto.inc' inherits the 'kernel' Class file.
		=> inherit kernel
4. The 'linux-yocto_5.10.bb' or 'linux-yocto_5.15.bb' Recipe files can fulfill any any dependency that asks for the 'virtual/kernel'.
5. During the Build, there is a need to call for one of these Kernel Recipes. This Configuration is done in the specific Machine Configuration file (.conf).
6. The 'PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/*' and the 'PREFERRED_VERSION_value' variables are used to perform the selection of the actual provider.
7. Suppose the Target Image Build is for the BeagleBone HW and the Kernel Recipe file 'linux-yocto_5.15.bb' is to be selected.
	---> In the 'meta-yocto-bsp/conf/machine/beaglebone-yocto.conf' file, the actual provider is selected:
		=> PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel ?= "linux-yocto"
		=> PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto ?= "5.15%"
