==================

Variable Assignment and Manipulations:
**************************************
1. The variable assignments allow to assign the value to a variable.
2. The assignments can be static text or might include the contents of the other variables.
3. The appending and prepending operations are also supported.
4. The following ways display the usage on the variables:
	=> S = "${WORKDIR}/postfix-${PV}"
	=> CFLAGS += "-DNO_ASM"
	=> CFLAGS:append = " --enable-important-feature"
