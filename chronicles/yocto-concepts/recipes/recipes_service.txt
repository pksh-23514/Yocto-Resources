Enabling System Services using Recipes:
=======================================
1. A Service is a process that usually starts on Boot and runs in the background.
2. If a system Service is required to be installed on the Target, the Recipes must include the required definitions for the Service.
3. It must be ensured that the Service 'init' script or the 'systemd' Service file is installed.
4. If the Recipe file doesn't automatically installs these files, it must be manually installed in the Recipe file using:
	1) The 'do_install:append' function if the Recipe file doesn't have the 'do_install' function.
	2) The end of the 'do_install' function if the Recipe file have it. In such cases, there is no need to create a new 'do_install:append' function.
5. While adding the installation for the Services manually, it must be ensured that the installation arranges the Output files mirroring the directory structure on the Target.
