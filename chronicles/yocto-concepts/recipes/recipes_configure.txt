Configuring the Build using Recipes:
====================================
1. Most SW provides some means of setting the Build-time Configuration options before the Compilation.
2. This step to Configure the options influence the behavior and features of the SW being Built.
3. These settings can be achieved by running a script with options or modifying a Build Configuration file.
4. A major part of the Build-time Configuration is about checking for the Build-time dependencies and possibly enabling certain optional functionalities as a result.
5. The following methods of Configuration are used:
	1) Autotools
	2) CMake
	3) Manually customize the 'do_configure' Task

Autotools:
**********
1. If the source files have a 'configure.ac' file, then the SW must be Built using Autotools. In such cases, only the Configurations must be modified.
2. While using Autotools, the Recipes must inherit the 'autotools' Class. It does not need to define the 'do_configure' Task as it is taken care by the 'autotools_do_configure'.
	=> inherit autotools
3. If the Recipes do not support the usage of Out-of-Tree Builds, it should inherit the 'autotools-brokensep' Class.
4. The Recipes should not update the 'do_configure' Task unless required.
5. However, the additional specific options can be passed in the Recipes using the variables:
	1) EXTRA_OECONF
	2) PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS

CMake:
******
1. If the source files have a 'CMakeLists.txt' file, then the SW must be Built using CMake. In such cases, only the Configurations must be modified.
2. While using CMake, the Recipes must inherit the 'cmake' Class. It does not need to define the 'do_configure' Task as it is taken care by the 'cmake_do_configure'.
	=> inherit cmake
3. The Recipes should not update the 'do_configure' Task unless required.
4. However, the additional specific options can be passed in the Recipes using the 'EXTRA_OECMAKE' variable.
5. If the custom CMake Toolchain files supplied by the SW being Built are to be installed by the Recipes, it can be done in the 'do_install' Task.
	=> do_install:append() {
		install -d ${D}${datadir}/cmake/Modules
		install -m 0644 custom_toolchain_file.cmake ${D}${datadir}/cmake/Modules/
