Unpacking the Source Code using Recipes:
========================================
1. During the Build, the 'do_unpack' Task executes the unpacking of the sources.
2. The 'S' variable points to the directory path where the source code is unpacked.
3. If the sources are fetched from an Upstream source Archived Tarball:
	1) The Tarball's internal structure matches the directory convention i.e. it is unpacked into a directory named:
	---> ${BPN}-${PV}
	2) There is no need to define the 'S' variable manually.
4. If the sources are fetched from an Upstream source that doesn't use the convention:
	1) The sources are unpacked into a directory with a different name than '${BPN}-${PV}'.
	2) The 'S' variable needs to be defined manually.
5. If the sources are fetched from the SCMs:
	1) There is no Archives and no conventional top-level directory.
	2) The 'S' variable needs to be defined manually.
6. The structure of the source must match the directory pointed by the 'S' variable for successful unpacking by the BitBake.
7. If the files mentioned in 'SRC_URI' variable have names end in a typical Archive extensions like '.tar', '.tar.gz', '.tar.bz2', '.zip' etc.
	1) They are automatically extracted during the 'do_unpack' Task.
