Licensing in Recipes:
=====================
1. The Recipes need to define the variables related to the Licenses under which the SW being Built is distributed.
2. The 'LICENSE' and the 'LIC_FILES_CHKSUM' variables are defined in the Recipes to fulfill the Licensing requirements.

LICENSE:
********
1. This variable specifies the Licenses applicable to the SW being Built by the Recipes.
	=> LICENSE = "license-name"
	---> Suppose, the given SW is under the GNU General Public License version 2. It can be set in the Recipe file as:
		=> LICENSE = "GPL-2.0-only"
2. If the Licenses under which the SW being Built is unknown, the source code should be referred for this information.
	1) This information is typically provided by the COPYING files, the LICENSE files or the README files.
	2) Sometimes, this information can is also available near the top of the source files.
3. The Licenses specified in the 'LICENSE' variable can have name of any length without any particular restrictions.
4. If the SW has multiple applicable Licenses, they are listed in the variable separated by 'spaces'.
	=> LICENSE = "license-1 license-2 ..."
5. For the standard Licenses name, the reference is:
	1) The 'meta/files/common-licenses' directory contains the Licenses file.
	2) The 'SPDXLICENSEMAP' flag names defined in the 'meta/conf/licenses.conf' file.
