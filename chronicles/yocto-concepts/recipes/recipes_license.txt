Licensing in Recipes:
=====================
1. The Recipes need to define the variables related to the Licenses under which the SW being Built is distributed.
2. The 'LICENSE' and the 'LIC_FILES_CHKSUM' variables are defined in the Recipes to fulfill the Licensing requirements.

LICENSE:
********
1. This variable specifies the Licenses applicable to the SW being Built by the Recipes.
	=> LICENSE = "license-name"
	---> Suppose, the given SW is under the GNU General Public License version 2. It can be set in the Recipe file as:
		=> LICENSE = "GPL-2.0-only"
2. If the Licenses under which the SW being Built is unknown, the source code should be referred for this information.
	1) This information is typically provided by the COPYING files, the LICENSE files or the README files.
	2) Sometimes, this information can is also available near the top of the source files.
3. The Licenses specified in the 'LICENSE' variable can have name of any length without any particular restrictions.
4. If the SW has multiple applicable Licenses, they are listed in the variable separated by 'spaces'.
	=> LICENSE = "license-1 license-2 ..."
5. For the standard Licenses name, the reference is:
	1) The 'meta/files/common-licenses' directory contains the Licenses file.
	2) The 'SPDXLICENSEMAP' flag names defined in the 'meta/conf/licenses.conf' file.

LIC_FILES_CHKSUM:
*****************
1. The OpenEmbedded Build system uses this variable to make sure that the Licenses text file has not been modified.
	=> LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://path;md5=license-checksum"
	---> Suppose, the given SW has a COPYING file. It can be set in the Recipe file as:
		=> LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=8ca43cbc842c2336e835926c2166c28b"
2. It points to the file in the sources that contains the Licenses text file and includes a SHA256 checksum to ensure that the file hasn't been changed silently.
3. The Licenses can be typically found in:
	1) LICENSE, COPYING, COPYRIGHT, or README.
	2) The top of source files (if License Header is embedded).
	3) The 'docs/' or the 'licenses/' directories.
4. If it finds any modification, the Build produces an error. This error has to be then checked and corrected manually.
	1) At the end of the Configuration step, the Build process compares the checksums of the Licenses file to be sure that the file has not changed.
	2) Any differences in the comparision results in an error with the message containing the current checksum value.
	3) Therefore, in the Recipes, put a placeholder for the checksum value and Build the Recipes to get the error message containing the correct checksum value to be used.
		=> LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=xxx"
	4) Modify the Recipes with the same correct value and the Build shall proceed without any error.
5. If the SW has multiple applicable Licenses, they are listed in the variable using multiple lines.
	=> LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = " \
	       file://COPYING;md5=8ca43cbc842c2336e835926c2166c28b \
	       file://LICENSE;md5=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef \
	       file://src/main.c;beginline=1;endline=20;md5=abcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefab \
	   "

Licenses Update:
****************
1. While changing the values of the 'LICENSE' or the 'LIC_FILES_CHKSUM' variables in the Recipes, the reason for the change must be explained using a 'License-Update:' tag.
2. The 'License-Update:' tag must be put in the Git commit message to document the reasons for the changes in the Licenses.
3. It can be trivial most of the times.
	=> License-Update: copyright years refreshed
4. However, in some cases, the actual Licensing terms would have changed. For such changes, the proper justification must be provided.
	=> License-Update: upstream relicensed project from GPL-2.0-only to Apache-2.0
5. This ensures transparency and traceability in the Build.
