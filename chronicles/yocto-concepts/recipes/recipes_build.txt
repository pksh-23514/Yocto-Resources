Building the Recipes:
=====================
1. The Recipe file can be Built by the BitBake using the below command:
	=> bitbake recipe-name
2. During the Build process, the Build system creates a temporary work directory for each Recipe to store:
	1) The extracted source files.
	2) The log files.
	3) The intermediate compiled binaries.
	4) The Packaging files.
3. The path to the per-Recipes temporary work directory depends on the context in which it is being Built. It is pointed by the 'WORKDIR' variable.
4. The command to determine the temporary work directory path is:
	=> bitbake -e recipe-name | grep ^WORKDIR=
5. If the Build directory is used to Build an Image based on ARM Architecture, the 'WORKDIR' for the Dropbear Recipe is:
	=> bitbake -e dropbear | grep ^WORKDIR=
	   WORKDIR="/home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build/tmp/work/cortexa15t2hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/dropbear/2020.81-r0"
6. After the Build is completed, these work directories can be examined to determine the state of the Recipe Build.
