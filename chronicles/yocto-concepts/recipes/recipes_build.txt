Building the Recipes:
=====================
1. The Recipe file can be Built by the BitBake using the below command:
	=> bitbake recipe-name
2. During the Build process, the Build system creates a temporary work directory for each Recipe to store:
	1) The extracted source files.
	2) The log files.
	3) The intermediate compiled binaries.
	4) The Packaging files.
3. The path to the per-Recipes temporary work directory depends on the context in which it is being Built. It is pointed by the 'WORKDIR' variable.
4. The command to determine the temporary work directory path is:
	=> bitbake -e recipe-name | grep ^WORKDIR=
5. If the Build directory is used to Build an Image based on ARM Architecture, the 'WORKDIR' for the Dropbear Recipe is:
	=> bitbake -e dropbear | grep ^WORKDIR=
	   WORKDIR="/home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build/tmp/work/cortexa15t2hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi/dropbear/2020.81-r0"
6. After the Build is completed, these work directories can be examined to determine the state of the Recipe Build.

BitBake Tasks for Recipes:
**************************
1. Based on the information provided by the Recipe file, the BitBake generates a set of Tasks to be performed in a chronological order.
2. The most important Tasks generated by the BitBake are as follows:
	1) do_fetch
	2) do_unpack
	3) do_patch
	4) do_configure
	5) do_compile
	5) do_install
	6) do_package
	7) do_package_write_*
3. There can be other Tasks as well generated by the BitBake based on the requirements for the particular Recipes.
4. Typically, the only Tasks that needs to be explicitly defined by the User in the Recipe file are:
	1) do_configure
	2) do_compile
	3) do_install
5. The other Tasks are provided by the Yocto Project Build system.
6. There is a dependency order for the Tasks. The BitBake executes the list of the Tasks from top to bottom.
7. There is an option provided by the BitBake to execute a specific Task of the Recipes:
	=> bitbake -c CMD recipe-name
	---> where 'CMD' is the specific Task to be executed.
