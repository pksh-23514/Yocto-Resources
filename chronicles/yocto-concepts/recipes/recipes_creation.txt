Locate or Automatically Create the Base Recipes:
================================================
1. The Recipes can be written from scratch by manually creating the '.bb' files.
2. However, there are three other ways to quickly get started with the Recipes:
	1) The 'recipetool create' command
	2) The 'devtool add' command
	3) The existing Recipes that are similar in functionality can be located and modified.

Creating Base Recipes using recipetool create:
**********************************************
1. The 'recipetool create' command automates the process to create a Recipe file with a given set of source code files.
2. If the source files can be pointed to or extracted, the command can automatically construct a Recipe and Configure all the pre-Build information in the Recipe file.
3. After the Build Environment script is sourced, the 'recipetool' can be executed in the Build directory.
	=> source oe-init-build-env
	=> recipetool -h
	   NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
	   usage: recipetool [-d] [-q] [--color COLOR] [-h] <subcommand> ...

	   OpenEmbedded recipe tool

	   options:
	     -d, --debug     Enable debug output
	     -q, --quiet     Print only errors
	     --color COLOR   Colorize output (where COLOR is auto, always, never)
	     -h, --help      show this help message and exit

	   subcommands:
	     create          Create a new recipe
	     newappend       Create a bbappend for the specified target in the specified layer
	     setvar          Set a variable within a recipe
	     appendfile      Create/update a bbappend to replace a target file
	     appendsrcfiles  Create/update a bbappend to add or replace source files
	     appendsrcfile   Create/update a bbappend to add or replace a source file
	   Use recipetool <subcommand> --help to get help on a specific command

4. The 'recipetool create -o OUTFILE' command can be used in multiple ways to create the Base Recipe and locate it correctly in the Layer containing the source files.
	=> recipetool create -o OUTFILE source
	---> The above Syntax is used to generate a Recipe based on the source. Once generated, the Recipe file resides in the existing source code Layer.
	=> recipetool create -o OUTFILE -x EXTERNALSRC source
	---> The above Syntax is used to generate a Recipe using the code extracted from the source.
	---> The extracted code is placed in it's own Layer defined by the 'EXTERNALSRC' variable. The Recipe file points to this directory.
	=> recipetool create -d -o OUTFILE source
	---> The above Syntax is used to generate a Recipe based on the source. Once generated, the Recipe file resides in the existing source code Layer.
	---> The '-d' option directs the 'recipetool' to generate the Debug information.

Creating Base Recipes using devtool add:
****************************************
1. The 'devtool add' command uses the same logic as the 'recipetool create'.
2. It also sets up the Environment that makes the process of changing the Recipe file or patching the source code.
