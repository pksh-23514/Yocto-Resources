Adding Headers for Devices Interface using Recipes:
===================================================
1. If the Recipes Build a SW that is required to communicate with Devices or an API is needed into a custom Kernel, the appropriate Header files should be provided.
2. The 'meta/recipes-kernel/linux-libc-headers/linux-libc-headers.inc' file is used to Build the 'libc' (like the 'glibc' or the 'musl').
	1) This Include file contains the set of standardized Kernel Headers for the C-library's usage.
	2) All the Applications in the Embedded Linux system rely on a consistent and reliable version of the 'libc'.
	3) Under no circumstances, this file should be modified or customized.
3. The correct way to interface the Devices or the custom Kernel is to use a separate Headers Package that provides the additional Header files for interfaces.
4. This Package then becomes a dependency for the SW that performs the interfaces.
