Fetching the Source Code using Recipes:
=======================================
1. The first thing that the Recipes must provides is the way to fetch the source files.
2. It is controlled by the 'SRC_URI' variable that points to the location of the source files.
3. The BitBake performs the 'do_fetch' Task to fetch the source files.
4. The 'do_fetch' Task uses the prefix of each entry of the 'SRC_URI' variable to determine the 'fetcher' to be used to get the source files.
5. The OpenEmbedded Build system uses the 'FILESOVERRIDES' variable for scanning the directory locations for local files in the 'SRC_URI' variable.
6. The 'SRC_URI' variable in the Recipe file must define each unique location for the corresponding source files.
7. It is a good practice to not hard-code the version numbers in a URL used in the 'SRC_URI' variable.
	1) The better way is to use the 'PV' variable in the 'SRC_URI' variable.
	2) The 'PV' variable causes the fetch Task to use the version number specified in the Recipe file name.
	3) Therefore, upgrading the Recipes to the future version would be as simple as renaming the Recipe file name to match the version.
	---> In the 'meta/recipes-devtools/strace/strace_5.5.bb' file, the source points to a single Tarball using the 'PV' variable.
	=> SRC_URI = "https://strace.io/files/${PV}/strace-${PV}.tar.xz"
8. The source can be specified from the Source Control Managers (SCMs) as well. For the Git repository, the following should be specified:
	1) The 'SRCREV' variable for the source file.
	2) The 'PV' variable for the source file must include a '+' sign in the definition.
	---> In the 'meta/recipes-sato/l3afpad/l3afpad_git.bb', the source is pointed to by the following definitions:
	=> PV = "0.8.18.1.11+git"
	=> SRC_URI = "git://github.com/stevenhoneyman/l3afpad.git;branch=master;protocol=https"
	=> SRCREV = "3cdccdc9505643e50f8208171d9eee5de11a42ff"
9. If the 'SRC_URI' variable includes a URL pointing to individual files from a remote Server other than a SCM, the checksums must be specified.
	1) The BitBake verifies the files against the defined checksums in the Recipe file to ensure that the files have not been tampered or modified.
	2) The 'SRC_URI[sha256sum]' is the most commonly used checksum.
10. There are multiple checksums supported with the 'SRC_URI' variable:
	1) SRC_URI[md5sum]
	2) SRC_URI[sha1sum]
	3) SRC_URI[sha256sum]
	4) SRC_URI[sha384sum]
	5) SRC_URI[sha512sum]
