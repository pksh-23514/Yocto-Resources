Package Groups:
===============
1. Package groups are a way to organize and manage a collection of SW Packages that should be installed together in an Image.
2. They are useful for the functional grouping of the Packages i.e. the Packages bundled for a specific functionality like Booting, Multimedia etc.
3. It is essentially a Recipe with the following properties:
	1) It doesn't Build the actual SW itself. It has to be listed in the 'IMAGE_INSTALL' variable to be used in the Build.
	2) It specifies a list of other Packages or Package groups that should be included together.
	3) It is used to simplify the Image Configuration and customization.
4. They are placed in the Layer at the directory path:
	=> meta-layer/
	   └── recipes-*
	       └── packagegroups
5. They can be searched in the Layers by running the following command:
	=> find recipes-*/ -name "packagegroups"
6. A Package group Recipe file have the prefix as 'packagegroup-' by convention to distinguish themselves. The file extension is same as for the Recipe file (.bb).
	1) packagegroup-core-boot.bb - The minimal set of Packages required to Boot the system.
	2) packagegroup-rpi-test.bb - The Raspberry Pi Test Package group.
7. Each Package group Recipe file is recommended to include the 'meta/classes/packagegroup.bbclass' file.
	1) It enables the file to be treated as a Package group.
	2) It avoids the unnecessary QA errors or warnings.
	3) It provides the default behavior and a standard structure expected for the Package group Recipes.
	4) It can be included in the Package group Recipe file preferably at the top itself:
		=> inherit packagegroup
8. The Package group is included in the Build by appending it to the 'IMAGE_INSTALL' variable in the Image Recipe file.
	=> IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " packagegroup-name"
