Packages:
=========
1. Packages are the Recipe's packaged Compiled Output produced by the BitBake.
2. They are the binaries that get installed on the Target Image (or RootFS).
3. It is a binary file in the format of '.ipk', '.deb' or '.rpm' which is Compiled from the Recipe's source code.
4. The format of the binaries is defined by the Package manager selected by the Build system using the 'PACKAGE_CLASSES' variable.
	1) .ipk => The Package manager is 'opkg'. This is used as default for Poky.
	2) .deb => The Package manager is 'dpkg' or 'apt'.
	3) .rpm => The Package manager is 'dnf', 'smart' or 'rpm'.
5. A single Recipe can generate multiple Packages which are then split based on the 'PACKAGES' variable.
6. The default value of the 'PACKAGE' variable is:
	=> PACKAGES = "${PN}-src ${PN}-dbg ${PN}-staticdev ${PN}-dev ${PN}-doc ${PN}-locale ${PACKAGE_BEFORE_PN} ${PN}"
	---> where the 'PN' variable refers to the primary Package name which is the Recipe name.
7. The Package splitting of the Recipe can produce:
	1) ${PN}-src => Contains the source code.
	2) ${PN}-dbg => Contains the binaries with Debug-Symbols.
	3) ${PN}-staticdev => Contains the Static libraries (*.a) for linking statically rather than dynamically.
	4) ${PN}-dev => Contains the development files i.e. the Header files, the Symlinks to Shared libraries (.so) etc required for Compilation.
	5) ${PN}-doc => Contains the documentation files.
	6) ${PN}-locale => Contains the locale and internationalization files used for supporting multiple languages.
	7) ${PACKAGE_BEFORE_PN} => Enables insertion of Packages before the main Package in the list.
	8) ${PN} => The primary (main) Package.
8. If the 'PACKAGES' variable is not defined by the Recipe, the BitBake will use the default value automatically.
9. Any additional logical Package can be defined in the Recipe file. The prefix '${PN}-' is maintained to distinguish it as a Package.
	=> PACKAGES = "${PN}-tools ${PN}-extras ${PN}"
	=> FILES_${PN} = "${bindir}/main-app"
	=> FILES_${PN}-tools = "${bindir}/tools/*"
	=> FILES_${PN}-extras = "${datadir}/extras"
	=> DESCRIPTION_${PN}-tools = "Extra tools"
	=> RDEPENDS_${PN}-tools = "${PN}"
