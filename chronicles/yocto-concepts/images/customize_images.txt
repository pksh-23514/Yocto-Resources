Customizing Images using local.conf:
====================================
1. The easiest way to customize the Image is to update the 'build/conf/local.conf' file.
2. The Package can be added using the 'IMAGE_INSTALL' variable with the ':append' operation.
	=> IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " package-name"
3. The ':append' operation is guaranteed. Therefore, it is preferred to use it over the '+=' operator to avoid ordering issues.
4. The limitations of using this method are:
	1) It is a local change and not as flexible as creating the custom Image Recipe.
	2) The changes made in the 'local.conf' file would affect all the Image Builds which is not suitable.
5. It is mostly used for testing purposes only as the changes are temporary and local.
