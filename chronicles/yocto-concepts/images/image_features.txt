Image Features:
===============
1. The features provide a mechanism for working out the Packages that is to be included in the generated Image.
2. The contents of the Image generated by the Build system can be controlled by the 'IMAGE_FEATURES' and 'EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES' variables.
3. They are typically used in the Image Recipe file.
4. Using these variables, there are several different pre-defined Packages that can be added to the Image.
5. The best practice is to use the 'IMAGE_FEATURES' variable in a Image Recipe file and the 'EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES' variable in the 'build/conf/local.conf' file.
