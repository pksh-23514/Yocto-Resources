Image Types:
============
1. If there is a particular layout to be used for the HW Board, then a specific Image type can be generated for the Target HW Board.
2. This custom Image type shall be designed as per the Boot flow of the Target HW.
3. This can be implemented by creating a custom Class file for the custom HW.
	---> The 'meta-raspberrypi/classes/sdcard_image-rpi.bbclass' file is used for the Raspberry Pi Boards.
4. The 'image_types.bbclass' file is mandatory to be inherited in the custom Class file.
5. The custom Class file must implement a 'IMAGE_CMD:type' function for the corresponding Image type.
	=> IMAGE_CMD:rpi-sdimg ()
6. After the custom Class file is created, the corresponding Image 'type' can be used in the 'IMAGE_FSTYPES' variable for generating the Image.
	=> # In the 'zeus' Branch for the 'meta-raspberrypi' Layer
	=> IMAGE_FSTYPES ?= "tar.bz2 ext3 rpi-sdimg"
