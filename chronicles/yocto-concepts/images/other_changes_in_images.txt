IMAGE_LINGUAS:
==============
1. The 'IMAGE_LINGUAS' variable specifies the locales to be installed on the Image during the RootFS generation process.
2. It ensures that any locale Packages that correspond to the Packages already selected for installation into the Image are installed.
	=> IMAGE_LINGUAS = "pt-br de-de"
	---> The Build system ensures any Brazilian Portuguese and German locale files that correspond to the Packages in the Image are installed.
	---> This includes all the locale Packages i.e. '*-locale-pt-br' and '*-locale-de-de' as well as '*-locale-pt' and '*-locale-de'.
3. The locales available in the Image can be verified by executing the following command on the Target HW:
	=> locale -a
