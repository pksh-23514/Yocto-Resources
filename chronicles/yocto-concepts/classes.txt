Classes:
========
1. Classes are used to Abstract common functionalities and share it among the multiple Recipe files. It is written in the BitBake Syntax.
2. They implement the concept of logical Encapsulation and Inheritance in the Build system.
3. For a Recipe to be able to use it, they inherit a Class and that is enough to enable the features of that particular Class.
4. However, any variable that is pre-defined in the inherited Class can be overridden in the Recipe file.
5. They are usually placed as the sub-directory 'classes' inside the 'meta*/' directory of the Build system.
6. These files have the suffix as '.bbclass' to distinguish themselves as a Class file.
7. The Syntax to inherit a Class in the Recipe file is:
	=> inherit <class_name>
	---> This inherits the 'class_name.bbclass' into the Recipe file.
8. They are expected to be structured and placed under the 'classes' directory in the Build system for the BitBake to be aware of their location.
9. The 'BBPATH' variable contains a colon-separated list used by BitBake to locate Class files. They are searched for  in the Build directory by the BitBake.
10. It is not mandatory for all the Layers (meta*/) to have the 'classes' sub-directory. It may or may not have depending upon the Inheritance requirements among Recipes.
