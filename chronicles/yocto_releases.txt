The Yocto Project Releases:
===========================
1. The Yocto Project Releases are known by their Major.Minor.Patch number.
	=> Yocto 4.0.27
2. The Major Release number implies the compatibility changes with the previous Releases.
3. The Minor Release number implies the significant changes up to but not including the compatibility changes.
4. The Minor revision number or the Patch number are for minor issues such as simple bug fixes, security updates etc.
5. The Yocto Project and the Poky Releases are released at the same time.

Release Frequency:
******************
1. The Major Releases happen every 6 months typically in April and October months of the year.
2. There are 2 possible lifecycles a Release may follow:
	1) Initial Release ---> Stable ---> Community ---> EOL
	2) Initial Release ---> LTS ---> Community ---> EOL
3. The Long Term Support Releases happen every 2 years and are announced in advance. They are maintained for 4 years after the initial Release.
4. The Stable Releases are maintained for 7 months.
5. The Community Support for a branch happens after the last Stable Release identified by the Stable or LTS maintainers.
	1) A call for the Community Support maintainer is sent to the mailing list followed by a 6 week waiting period.
	2) The branches only have Community Support status if there is an active Community member willing to step into the maintainer role for that series.
6. If there is no new Community Support maintainer available even after the waiting period, that branch status becomes EOL (End of Life).
7. The Minor Releases do not have a fixed schedule. They happen as and when required, typically when there are enough bug fixes or enhancements to the Major Release accumulated.

Layers and Branches:
********************
1. The different types of Layers are developed simultaneously by several different Communities for the different flavors of the Yocto Project.
2. Therefore, these Layers are split into separate branches in the Git.
3. Since the Layers of the same branch name are compatible to each other, there cannot be any mixing of the branches among the different Layers in a Build system.
4. If there are any Layers with different branch names, it leads to conflicts in the Build process.
5. Each Layer has the 'LAYERSERIES_COMPAT' variable defined in the 'conf/layer.conf' file to declare the branch name compatible with it.
6. The choice of Layer must be evaluated based on the compromise between:
	1) The latest Stable branch
	2) The latest branch supported by all the Layers
