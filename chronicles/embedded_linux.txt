Embedded Linux:
===============
1. The Embedded Linux is a customized version of the Linux OS optimized to run on an Embedded system.
2. The Embedded systems are Devices with certain specific functionalities and have resource constraints.
3. The major elements of Embedded Linux are:
	1) Toolchain
	2) Bootloader
	3) Linux Kernel
	4) Root Filesystem (RootFS)
	5) Embedded Applications specific to the system

Toolchain:
**********
1. It consists of the Cross-Compilation tools for building the binaries for a Target Architecture.
2. They provide the necessary Compilers, Assemblers, Linkers, Debuggers and other utilities for the Cross-Compilation.

Bootloader:
***********
1. It initializes the HW, loads the Kernel into the Memory and passes the control to the Kernel.
2. It provides a basic Shell, Environment variables and has the ability to load the Kernel and the Device Tree from the Flash Memory or Network.
3. The most popular Bootloader is the U-Boot.

Kernel:
*******
1. It is the core of the OS that manages the system resources and provides and interface to interact with the HW.
2. The Linux Kernel is customized for the Embedded systems with the features included on-demand.

RootFS:
*******
1. It consits of the essential File systems and directories (/bin, /sbin, /lib, /etc, /dev, /proc, /sys, /usr).
2. The programs and libraries are available once the Kernel is up in the Memory.
3. The RootFS can be made Read-only for security purposes.
