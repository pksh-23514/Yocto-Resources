meta-selftest:
==============
1. The 'meta-selftest' is a test Layer that contains additional Classes, Recipes and Configurations files used by the 'scripts/oe-selftest' script in Poky.
2. It is used to verify the behavior of the Build system.
3. It is probably a mistake to include it in the Yocto Build unless there is a specific requirement to run the self-tests.
4. It depends on the 'meta' Layer in the Poky.
