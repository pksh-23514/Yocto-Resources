meta-skeleton:
==============
1. The 'meta-skeleton' is a demo Layer that contains the template Recipes and Configuration files for the actual BSP and Kernel development.
2. It is a sandbox for learning the process to define custom Recipes and Machine Configuration.
3. It also provides the minimal working examples like Services, Kernel Recipes, Bare-Metal Applications etc.
4. It is expected by the developer to copy and modify these sample files to create the custom Layers for the Build system.
5. They are not intended to be used verbatim i.e. they shouldn't be used directly without proper customization as:
	1) They are minimal and incomplete without proper versioning.
	2) They provide no real functionality.
	3) They are only used as a learning tool.
6. It depends on the 'meta' Layer in the Poky.
