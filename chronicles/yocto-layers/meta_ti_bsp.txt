	2) J7200, J721e, J721s2, J742s2, J784s4 etc.
4. It supplies the Device Tree and Board specific Configurations for the TI HW.
5. It provides the Recipes for:
	1) The Kernel versions supported on the TI SoC.
	2) The u-Boot Bootloader for the TI SoC.
6. It provides the Firmware needed by the TI SoC and the Drivers support for various Peripherals on the Board.
7. It provides various security features and GPU support to the TI HW.
8. It enables the Image Build that can run on the TI Evaluation Modules (EVMs) as well as the custom HW based on these TI SoCs.
9. It provides the TI-specific tools and utilities.
10. It contains the following Recipes and Configurations as sub-directories:
