meta-arm:
=========
1. The 'meta-arm' is an official Board Support Package (BSP) and Toolchain Layer provided by the ARM to support their platforms.
2. It contains the Meta-data, Configurations and Recipes specifically to support a wide range of Arm-based platforms, tools and features.
3. It provides the support for the following:
	1) ARM CPU families including Neoverse, Cortex-A, Cortex-R and Cortex-M.
	2) ARM fixed virtual platforms (FVP).
	3) ARM reference HW Boards like Corstoneâ€‘1000, FVP Base virtual platform and Juno development Board.
	4) ARM SystemReady infrastructure requirements (IR) on FVP Base.
	5) ARM Toolchain and Firmware integration like ARM Trusted Firmware (ATF), u-Boot, ARM GCC, ARM binary Toolchain, SCP Firmware and UEFI.
	6) ARM SW like OP-TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).
4. It contains the following Layers as sub-directories:
	1) meta-arm-bsp
	2) meta-arm-systemready
	3) meta-arm-toolchain
	4) meta-arm
5. The 'meta-arm' sub-directory contains the general Recipes for the ARM Architecture such as Firmware, FVPs and ARM-specific integration.
6. The 'meta-arm-bsp' sub-directory contains the Board Support Package (BSP) for ARM reference platforms such as FVP Base, Corstone-1000 and Juno.
7. The 'meta-arm-toolchain' sub-directory contains the Recipes to Build ARM binary Toolchains (ARM GCC).
8. It depends on the 'meta', 'meta-python' and 'meta-arm-toolchain' Layers.
