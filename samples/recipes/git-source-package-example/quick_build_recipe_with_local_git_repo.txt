Quick Build of Recipe for ARM Architecture with Local Git Source:
=================================================================

1. On the Home directory of the Host Machine, create a local Git repository to contain the sources to be Build using a Recipe.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~$ mkdir hello-world
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~$ cd hello-world/
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/prabhat_kiran/hello-world/.git/

2. Include the C file and the Makefile in the local Git repository.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ vi program.c
---> Add the contents of the C file to be Built using the Recipe.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ vi Makefile
---> Add the contents of the Makefile to Build the C file using the Recipe.

3. Commit these files into the local Git repository.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ git status 
On branch master
