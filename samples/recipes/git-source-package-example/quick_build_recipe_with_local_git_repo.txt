Quick Build of Recipe for ARM Architecture with Local Git Source:
=================================================================

1. On the Home directory of the Host Machine, create a local Git repository to contain the sources to be Build using a Recipe.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~$ mkdir hello-world
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~$ cd hello-world/
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/prabhat_kiran/hello-world/.git/

2. Include the C file and the Makefile in the local Git repository.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ vi program.c
---> Add the contents of the C file to be Built using the Recipe.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ vi Makefile
---> Add the contents of the Makefile to Build the C file using the Recipe.

3. Commit these files into the local Git repository.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ git status 
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	Makefile
	program.c

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ git add Makefile 
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ git commit -m "Added the Makefile"
[master (root-commit) b5856ef] Added the Makefile

prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ git add program.c 
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ git commit -m "Added the C file"

nothing to commit, working tree clean

4. Verify the Git log for the local Git repository.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/hello-world$ git log
commit d0b576c22ce9064c20442785954970c7143f32ed (HEAD -> master)

    Added the C file

commit b5856efb8210d6f45573b634a3887c481aff27da
Author: prabhat_kiran <prabhat_kiran@github.com>
Date:   Fri Sep 12 18:26:33 2025 +0530

    Added the Makefile

5. For building the Image for ARM Architecture instead of the Intel (x86) Architecture, the changes shall be made to the 'local.conf' file in the 'build/conf' directory.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ vi conf/local.conf
=> MACHINE ?= "qemuarm"
=> #MACHINE ?= "qemux86-64"

6. The Layer directory should be created for the the BitBake to pick it up during the Build. The 'bitbake-layers' command is used to create and add the compatible Layer.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers create-layer ../meta-layer
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
Add your new layer with 'bitbake-layers add-layer /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer'
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-layer
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers show-layers
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
layer                 path                                      priority
==========================================================================
meta                  /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta   5
meta-poky             /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-poky  5
meta-yocto-bsp        /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-yocto-bsp  5
meta-layer            /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer  5

7. The Recipe file must be placed in the Layer structure in such a way that the BitBake is able to pick them up during the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ cd ../meta-layer/
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer$ ls
conf  COPYING.MIT  README  recipes-example
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer$ cd recipes-example/

---> It is important to note that the name of the Recipe folder must match with the name of the Recipe file name being used to Build the SW.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ mkdir hello-local-git
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ ls
example  hello-local-git

8. Include the Recipe file in the Recipe folder i.e. 'hello-local-git' for the BitBake to be able to read it during the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ cd hello-local-git/
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-local-git$ vi hello-local-git_0.1.bb
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-local-git$ cat hello-local-git_0.1.bb 
=> DESCRIPTION = "A sample C-program from a Local Git Repository"
=> LICENSE = "MIT"
=> LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"

=> SRC_URI = "git:///home/prabhat_kiran/hello-world;branch=master;protocol=file"
=> SRCREV = "${AUTOREV}"

=> S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

=> do_install() {
=>     install -d ${D}${bindir}
=>     install -m 0755 program ${D}${bindir}
=> }

9. This is the final Layer directory structure which is compatible with the BitBake for the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-local-git$ cd ..
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ tree hello-local-git
hello-local-git
└── hello-local-git_0.1.bb
