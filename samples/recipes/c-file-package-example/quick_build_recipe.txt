Quick Build of Recipe for ARM Architecture using the Build Directory:
=====================================================================

1. For building the Image for ARM Architecture instead of the Intel (x86) Architecture, the changes shall be made to the 'local.conf' file in the 'build/conf' directory.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ vi conf/local.conf
=> MACHINE ?= "qemuarm"
=> #MACHINE ?= "qemux86-64"

2. The Layer directory should be created for the the BitBake to pick it up during the Build. The 'bitbake-layers' command is used to create and add the compatible Layer.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers create-layer ../meta-layer
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
Add your new layer with 'bitbake-layers add-layer /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer'
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-layer
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers show-layers
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
layer                 path                                      priority
==========================================================================
meta                  /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta   5
meta-poky             /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-poky  5
meta-yocto-bsp        /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-yocto-bsp  5
meta-layer            /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer  5

3. The Recipe file and the source C file must be placed in the Layer structure in such a way that the BitBake is able to pick them up during the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ cd ../meta-layer/
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer$ ls
conf  COPYING.MIT  README  recipes-example
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer$ cd recipes-example/

---> It is important to note that the name of the Recipe folder must match with the name of the Recipe file name being used to Build the SW.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ mkdir hello
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ ls
example  hello
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ cd hello/
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello$ mkdir files
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello$ cd files/

4. Include the C file in the 'files' directory of the Layer.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello/files$ vi hello.c
---> Add the contents of the C file to be Built using the Recipe.

5. Include the Recipe file in the Recipe folder i.e. 'hello' for the BitBake to be able to read it during the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello/files$ cd ..
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello$ vi hello_0.1.bb
---> Add the contents of the Recipe file to Build the C file.
---> It is possible that the 'LIC_FILES_CHKSUM' is unknown. Therefore, just add a placeholder for the checksum value to the variable and proceed with the Build.
=> LICENSE = "MIT"
=> LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=xxx"

6. This is the final Layer directory structure which is compatible with the BitBake for the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello$ cd ..
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ tree hello/
hello/
├── files
│   └── hello.c
└── hello_0.1.bb

1 directory, 2 files

7. On the Host Machine, run the 'bitbake' command with Target as the Recipe name for a quick Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake hello

Summary: There were 2 ERROR messages, returning a non-zero exit code.

8. As the 'LIC_FILES_CHKSUM' is unknown, the Build would fail with an error. However, the error message contains the correct checksum value to be used in the Recipe file.

9. After updating the correct checksum value to the 'LIC_FILES_CHKSUM' variable, run the 'bitbake' command with Target as the Recipe name for a quick Build.

10. After the Recipe Build is successful, the 'WORKDIR' directory contains all the files and directories generated during the Build.
