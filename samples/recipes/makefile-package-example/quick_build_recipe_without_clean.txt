Quick Build of Recipe for ARM Architecture without 'clean' Rule:
================================================================

1. . For building the Image for ARM Architecture instead of the Intel (x86) Architecture, the changes shall be made to the 'local.conf' file in the 'build/conf' directory.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ vi conf/local.conf
=> MACHINE ?= "qemuarm"
=> #MACHINE ?= "qemux86-64"

2. The Layer directory should be created for the the BitBake to pick it up during the Build. The 'bitbake-layers' command is used to create and add the compatible Layer.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers create-layer ../meta-layer
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
Add your new layer with 'bitbake-layers add-layer /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer'
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-layer
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers show-layers
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
layer                 path                                      priority
==========================================================================
meta                  /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta   5
meta-poky             /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-poky  5
meta-yocto-bsp        /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-yocto-bsp  5
meta-layer            /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer  5

3. The Recipe file and the source C file must be placed in the Layer structure in such a way that the BitBake is able to pick them up during the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ cd ../meta-layer/
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer$ ls
conf  COPYING.MIT  README  recipes-example
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer$ cd recipes-example/

---> It is important to note that the name of the Recipe folder must match with the name of the Recipe file name being used to Build the SW.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ mkdir sample
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ ls
example  sample
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ cd sample
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/sample$ mkdir files
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/sample$ cd files/

4. Include the C file in the 'files' directory of the Layer.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/sample/files$ vi program.c
---> Add the contents of the C file to be Built using the Recipe.

5. In the Makefile, if the 'clean' rule is not defined explicitly, the Recipe Build can throw an error.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/sample/files$ vi Makefile
---> Add the contents of the Makefile to Build the C file using the Recipe.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/sample/files$ cat Makefile
=> CFLAGS = -g -Wall -DUSE_SYSCALL

=> TARGET = program

=> all: $(TARGET)

=>	$(TARGET): $(TARGET).c
=>		$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(TARGET).c

=>	install:
=>		install -d $(DESTDIR)
=>		install -m 0755 $(TARGET) $(DESTDIR)

=>	uninstall:
=>		rm $(DESTDIR)$(TARGET)

6. Include the Recipe file in the Recipe folder i.e. 'sample' for the BitBake to be able to read it during the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/sample/files$ cd ..
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/sample$ vi sample_0.1.bb
---> Add the contents of the Recipe file to Build the C file.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/sample$ cat sample_0.1.bb
=> DESCRIPTION = "A simple Makefile based C-program with the CLEAN rule removed from Makefile"
=> LICENSE = "MIT"
=> LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${COMMON_LICENSE_DIR}/MIT;md5=0835ade698e0bcf8506ecda2f7b4f302"

=> SRC_URI = " \
=>     file://program.c \
=>     file://Makefile \
=> "

=> S = "${WORKDIR}"

=> do_compile() {
=>     make
=> }

=> do_install() {
=>     oe_runmake install DESTDIR=${D}/usr/bin
=> }

7. This is the final Layer directory structure which is compatible with the BitBake for the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/sample$ cd ..
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ tree sample
