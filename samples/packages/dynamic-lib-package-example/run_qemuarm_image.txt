Running the Yocto Image with Recipe having Dynamic Library for ARM Architecture on QEMU:
========================================================================================

1. To execute the 'core-image-minimal' Image Built for 'qemuarm' Architecture on QEMU, the below commands can be provided.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ runqemu qemuarm core-image-minimal nographic
runqemu - INFO - Running MACHINE=qemuarm bitbake -e ...

2. The dynamic library should be located in the directory on which it is installed in the Recipe file along with the specified file permissions.
root@qemuarm:~# ls -l /usr/lib/lib_dynamic.so.1.0
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          5364 Mar  9  2018 /usr/lib/lib_dynamic.so.1.0

3. The SONAME link to the dynamic library is also located in the directory along with the real dynamic library. It points to the real dynamic library.
root@qemuarm:~# ls -l /usr/lib/lib_dynamic.so.1
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            18 Mar  9  2018 /usr/lib/lib_dynamic.so.1 -> lib_dynamic.so.1.0

4. However, the Header file and the Linker name link to the dynamic library is not located in the Image.
root@qemuarm:~# ls -l /usr/lib/lib_dynamic.so
ls: /usr/lib/lib_dynamic.so: No such file or directory
root@qemuarm:~# ls -l /usr/include/dynamic_lib.h
ls: /usr/include/dynamic_lib.h: No such file or directory

5. The Header file and the the Linker name link to the dynamic library related Package i.e. '${PN}-dev' is not added in the 'IMAGE_INSTALL' variable of the Image Recipe file.
	1) Unlike for the static library, for the dynamic library, there is no dependency on the 'hello-dynamic-lib-dev' Package.
	2) So, the Header file or the Linker name link to the dynamic library is not located in the "/usr/include/" or "/usr/lib/" directories respectively.
