Quick Build of Recipe for ARM Architecture with File Installed at Other Location:
=================================================================================

1. For building the Image for ARM Architecture instead of the Intel (x86) Architecture, the changes shall be made to the 'local.conf' file in the 'build/conf' directory.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ vi conf/local.conf
=> MACHINE ?= "qemuarm"
=> #MACHINE ?= "qemux86-64"

2. The Layer directory should be created for the the BitBake to pick it up during the Build. The 'bitbake-layers' command is used to create and add the compatible Layer.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers create-layer ../meta-layer
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
Add your new layer with 'bitbake-layers add-layer /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer'
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-layer
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ bitbake-layers show-layers
NOTE: Starting bitbake server...
layer                 path                                      priority
==========================================================================
meta                  /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta   5
meta-poky             /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-poky  5
meta-yocto-bsp        /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-yocto-bsp  5
meta-layer            /home/prabhat_kiran/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer  5

3. The Recipe file and the source C file must be placed in the Layer structure in such a way that the BitBake is able to pick them up during the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ cd ../meta-layer/
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer$ ls
conf  COPYING.MIT  README  recipes-example
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer$ cd recipes-example/

---> It is important to note that the name of the Recipe folder must match with the name of the Recipe file name being used to Build the SW.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ mkdir hello-package
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ ls
example  hello-package
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ cd hello-package/
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-package$ mkdir files
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-package$ cd files/

4. Include the C file and the README file in the 'files' directory of the Layer.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-package/files$ vi hello.c
---> Add the contents of the C file to be Built using the Recipe.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-package/files$ vi README.txt
---> Add the contents of the README file to be Built using the Recipe.

5. Include the Recipe file in the Recipe folder i.e. 'hello-package' for the BitBake to be able to read it during the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-package/files$ cd ..
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-package$ vi hello-package_0.1.bb
---> Add the contents of the Recipe file to Build the C file.

6. This is the final Layer directory structure which is compatible with the BitBake for the Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example/hello-package$ cd ..
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/meta-layer/recipes-example$ tree hello-package
