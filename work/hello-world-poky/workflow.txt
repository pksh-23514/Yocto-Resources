Host Machine Requirements:
==========================
1. 1. At least 90 GB of free Disk space.
2. At least 8 GB of RAM and as many CPU Cores as possible.
3. A supported Linux Distribution i.e. recent Releases of Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, Debian or Ubuntu.
4. The Yocto Project version => 4.0
5. The codename of Poky with the Yocto Project version => Kirkstone

Preparing the Build Host Machine:
=================================
1. For the below commands, it is assumed that the Host Machine has Ubuntu installed on it.
2. The essential Packages that must be installed are:
	=> sudo apt install build-essential chrpath cpio debianutils diffstat file gawk gcc git iputils-ping libacl1 liblz4-tool locales \
		python3 python3-git python3-jinja2 python3-pexpect python3-pip python3-subunit socat texinfo unzip wget xz-utils zstd
2. Ensure that the following utilities have these minimum version numbers:
	1) Git 1.8.3.1 or greater
	2) tar 1.28 or greater
	3) Python 3.6.0 or greater
	4) gcc 7.5 or greater
	5) GNU make 4.0 or greater
3. Ensure that the 'en_US.UTF-8' locale is enabled on the Host:
	=> locale --all-locales | grep en_US.utf8
	1) If the locale is not present, it has to be configured in the 'locales' Package:
		=> sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
		---> The above command requires an interactive Shell i.e GUI on the Host Machine.
4. If required, the Packages needed to Build the Project manuals:
	=> sudo apt install git inkscape locales make python3-saneyaml python3-sphinx-rtd-theme sphinx texlive-latex-extra

Accessing the Source Repository:
================================
1. Check for the Release Page to choose the Yocto Project version and codename for Poky required.
	1) The link to the Poky Releases information is: https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases
	2) Remember to choose the codename corresponding to either the latest Stable Release or the Long Term Support Release.

Cloning and Check-out Branch:
=============================
1. In the working directory, clone the complete Poky repository.
	=> git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
	---> Once the cloning is completed, the 'master' branch is checked-out by default.
2. Based on the selected codename for Poky, switch to that branch of the cloned repository.
	=> git checkout -t origin/kirkstone -b my-kirkstone
	---> The branch 'my-kirkstone' is created to track the remote branch 'kirkstone' from 'origin'.
3. The local branch must be kept in sync with the remote branch periodically.
	=> git pull
