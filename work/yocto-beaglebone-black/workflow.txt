BeagleBone Black Yocto Image Build:
===================================

1. The BeagleBone Black is one of the reference Boards supported by the Yocto Project.
	=> MACHINE ?= "beaglebone-yocto"

2. Run the Build Environment setup script on the Host Machine.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky$ source oe-init-build-env build_BBB

3. Open the 'local.conf' file to update the 'MACHINE' variable for the BeagleBone Black Image Build.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB$ vi conf/local.conf
=> MACHINE ?= "beaglebone-yocto"
=> #MACHINE ?= "qemux86-64"

4. Execute the 'bitbake' command to Build an Image with the new Configuration.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB$ bitbake core-image-minimal

Preparing SD card for Booting:
==============================
1. Connect the SD card to the Host using a card reader.

2. Unmount the partitions (if any) by executing the following command on the correct Device (/dev/sdx).
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo umount /dev/sdx

3. The SD card has to formatted for the previous partitions using the "fdisk" utility on Linux.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdx

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.34)
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Command (m for help): d
Partition number (1, default 1): 1

Partition 1 has been deleted.

4. The first partition has to be created for containing the Boot files with a size of 32 MB.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdx

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.34)
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Command (m for help): n
Partition type
   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)
Select (default p): p
Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1
First sector (2048-62552063, default 2048): 2048
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-62552063, default 62552063): +32M

Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 32 MiB.
Partition #1 contains a ext4 signature.

Do you want to remove the signature? [Y]es/[N]o: Y

The signature will be removed by a write command.

5. The second partition has to be created for containing the RootFS with all the remaining size on the SD card.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdx

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.34)
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Command (m for help): n
Partition type
   p   primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free)
   e   extended (container for logical partitions)
Select (default p): p
Partition number (2-4, default 2): 2
First sector (67584-62552063, default 67584): 67584
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (67584-62552063, default 62552063): 62552063

Created a new partition 2 of type 'Linux' and of size 29.8 GiB.

6. The first partition must be made Bootable and the signature must be FAT32.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdx

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.34)
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Command (m for help): a
Partition number (1,2, default 2): 1

The bootable flag on partition 1 is enabled now.

Command (m for help): t
Partition number (1,2, default 2): 1
Hex code (type L to list all codes): c

Changed type of partition 'Linux' to 'W95 FAT32 (LBA)'.

7. There is no change for the signature of the second partition as it is already having 'Linux' signature. So, the write command can be issued to actually partition the SD card.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo fdisk /dev/sdx

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.34)
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered.
Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.

8. For Mounting these 2 partitions, the label for each partition must be set using the following commands.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo mkfs.vfat -n "BOOT" /dev/sdx1
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo mkfs.ext4 -L "ROOTFS" /dev/sdx2

Copying the Boot Images and Root FS to SD card:
===============================================
1. Remove and re-insert the SD card. The 2 partitions created are Mounted separately as 'BOOT' and 'ROOTFS' at the path '/media/$USER'.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ ls /media/$USER
BOOT  ROOTFS

2. If the Mounting doesn't happen automatically, it has to be done manually by executing the following command on the correct Device (/dev/sdx).
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo mount /dev/sdx1 /media/$USER/BOOT
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo mount /dev/sdx2 /media/$USER/ROOTFS

3. After the Mounting is successful, the Boot files, the Kernel Image and the Device Tree has to be copied to the SD card 'BOOT' partition.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo cp MLO /media/$USER/BOOT
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo cp u-boot.img /media/$USER/BOOT
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo cp zImage /media/$USER/BOOT
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo cp am335x-boneblack.dtb /media/$USER/BOOT

4. The RootFS has to be uncompressed and then placed at the SD card 'ROOTFS' partition.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo tar -xf core-image-minimal-beaglebone-yocto.tar.bz2 /media/$USER/ROOTFS

5. It is a good practice to execute the 'sync' command after copying the files on the SD card.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sync

6. The SD card partitions can now be Unmounted before removing the SD card.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo umount /dev/sdx1
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo umount /dev/sdx2

7. The SD card is ready to be inserted on the BeagleBone Black.

SD card Booting:
================
1. The USB (/dev/ttyUSBx) where the Serial connection is established can be verified and opened.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build_BBB/tmp/deploy/images$ sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSBx

2. Make sure to follow the process to Boot from the SD card instead of the eMMC (which is checked before) while powering up the Board.

3. The Boot logs are displayed on the Minicom window. After the Boot is successful, it reaches the Login stage.
