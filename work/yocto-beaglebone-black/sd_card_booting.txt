BeagleBone Black Serial Setup:
==============================
1. The UART connection has to be established between the Host and the Target by connecting a USB to TTL Serial cable (Prolific PL2303).
2. This Serial connection is a cross-connection with the Tx pin of the cable going to the Rx pin on the Target and vice-versa.
3. The Serial pins (J1) on the BeagleBone Black are connected to the cable in the following manner:
	1) J1 (pin-1) => GND
	2) J1 (pin-4) => RX
	3) J1 (pin-5) => TX

BeagleBone Black SD Card Booting Process:
=========================================
1. After the UART connection is established successfully, the Minicom can should be configured on the Host Machine.
	=> sudo minicom -s
	=> The 'Serial port setup' is done with the below Configurations and saved:
		1) Hardware Flow Control : No
		2) Software Flow Control : No
2. The USB (/dev/ttyUSBx) where the Serial connection is established can be verified and opened.
	=> sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSBx
3. Insert the SD card with the BOOT and ROOTFS partitions containing the Image files.
4. The Board can be powered up by connecting a USB cable Type-B from the Host to the USB mini-port on the Target.
5. The Board Boots up by using the pre-existing Images from the eMMC. But this is not desirable as the Image is flashed on the SD card.
6. Therefore, before powering up the Board, the Boot button (S2) is to be pressed and held for changing the Boot sequence.
7. After 2-5 seconds, the Boot button can be released. This causes the Board to Boot from the SD card instead of the eMMC.
8. The Board is now booted-up successfully from the SD card if it reaches the Login stage.
9. This is a tedious process to Boot the Board by pressing the Boot button everytime.
