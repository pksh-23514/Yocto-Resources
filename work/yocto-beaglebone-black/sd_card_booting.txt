BeagleBone Black Serial Setup:
==============================
1. The UART connection has to be established between the Host and the Target by connecting a USB to TTL Serial cable (Prolific PL2303).
2. This Serial connection is a cross-connection with the Tx pin of the cable going to the Rx pin on the Target and vice-versa.
3. The Serial pins (J1) on the BeagleBone Black are connected to the cable in the following manner:
	1) J1 (pin-1) => GND
	2) J1 (pin-4) => RX
	3) J1 (pin-5) => TX
