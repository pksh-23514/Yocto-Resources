==============================
1. Connect the SD card to the Host using a card reader.
2. The other way to create the partitions on the SD card is using the GParted application.
3. Launch the GParted application and authenticate using the PC password.
4. Select the correct Device (/dev/sdx) by checking the Device details from "/dev".
5. The SD card initially could already have a particular file system formatting such as FAT32.
6. Right click on the Device and 'Delete' all the partitions so that the complete storage is available for allocation.
7. After deleting the existing partitions, the Device partiton displays as "unallocated".
8. Right click again and select 'New' to create a new partition on the SD card. Select the following options and click 'Add':

	4) Label: ROOTFS
10. Click on the 'Apply All Operations' (green arrow) option and select 'Apply' on the dialogue box.
11. The operation will take some time to delete and add the partitions.
12. There are some flags to be managed for the BOOT partition to make it bootable. Right click on the partition and select the following options from 'Manage Flags':
	1) boot
	2) lba
13. After this selection, the partition will have these flags displayed along with the other details.
