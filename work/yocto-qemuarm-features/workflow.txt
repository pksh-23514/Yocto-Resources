Image Build using the Correct Poky Branch:
==========================================
1. In the working directory, clone the complete Poky repository.
	=> git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
	---> Once the cloning is completed, the 'master' branch is checked-out by default.
2. Based on the selected codename for Poky, switch to that branch of the cloned repository.
	=> cd poky
	=> git checkout -t origin/kirkstone -b my-kirkstone
	---> The branch 'my-kirkstone' is created to track the remote branch 'kirkstone' from 'origin'.
3. The script 'oe-init-build-env' is used to setup the OpenEmbedded Build Environment.
	=> cd poky
	=> source oe-init-build-env [build_dir]
	---> The argument 'build_dir' is optional. It is used to provide the Absolute/Relative directory path to setup the Build directory. The default is './build'
4. It adds the BitBake utility to the 'PATH' variable of the Host Machine.
5. It moves the control to the Build directory with the 'conf' directory containing the necessary Configuration files.
6. In the 'conf' directory, the Target Machine is selected by default as 'qemuarm'.
	=> MACHINE ?= "qemuarm"
7. The final step to Build the Image is by selecting the Target Image and passing it to the BitBake.
	=> bitbake core-image-minimal
8. After the Build is successful, the Target Image binaries are present under the 'build' directory.
