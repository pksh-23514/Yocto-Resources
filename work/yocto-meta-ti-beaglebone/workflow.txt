============================================

2. It also provides the support for a broad range of Peripherals for the TI HW and TI-specific tools.
3. The Link to clone the 'meta-ti' Layer is: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-ti
4. It can be cloned into the same path as the Poky repository or anywhere convinient.
5. It is dependent on the 'meta' and the 'meta-arm' Layers. The dependencies shall be fulfilled before using it in the Build system.
6. The Link to clone the 'meta-arm' Layer is: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-arm
