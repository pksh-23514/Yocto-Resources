SD card Booting:
================

1. The USB (/dev/ttyUSBx) where the Serial connection is established can be verified and opened.
prabhat_kiran@coldstone:~/Documents/Learnings/Yocto_Resources/Poky/poky/build$ sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSBx

2. Make sure to follow the process to Boot from the SD card instead of the eMMC (which is checked before) while powering up the Board.

3. The Boot logs are displayed on the Minicom window. After the Boot is successful, it reaches the Login stage.

4. There is a stark difference in the Boot logs displayed here as compared to the Boot logs when the Board was running Image Built from the 'meta-yocto-bsp' Layer.
	1) The Kernel version can be verified by executing the below command:
		=> uname -a
	2) The reason for the difference in logs is the Linux Kernel version being used. The TI maintains a separate Linux Kernel repository.
		=> KERNEL_GIT_URI ?= "git://git.ti.com/git/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel.git"

5. To stop at the u-Boot, the Enter key must be pressed before the timeout happens during the Boot process.
