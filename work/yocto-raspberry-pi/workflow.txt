Official Raspberry Pi BSP Layer Integration with Poky:
======================================================
1. The 'meta-raspberrypi' is an official Board Support Package (BSP) Layer for the Raspberry Pi Boards.
2. It provides the support for a broad range of Peripherals for the Raspberry Pi HW.
3. The link to clone the 'meta-raspberrypi' is: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
4. It can be cloned into the same path as the Poky repository or anywhere convinient.
5. It is dependent on the 'meta' and the 'meta-oe' Layers. The dependencies shall be fulfilled before using it in the Build system.
6. The link to clone the 'meta-oe' Layer is: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
7. Once all the dependencies are fulfilled for the Layers, the Build process can be started.
8. The most important point is to maintain the same branch names (i.e. Poky codenames) in all the Layers used for the Yocto Build to maintain compatibility.
